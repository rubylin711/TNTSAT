 *    integrate the NagraVision CA applications. All functions of this API may
 *    be concurrently called from different task contexts (multi-tasking OS).
 *    They must therefore be re-entrant. On the other hand, osTaskIdentify() and
 *    osTimerCreate() are the only functions of this API that cannot be called
 *    from any task context, but only in contexts created by osTaskCreate().

 *                 or until the timeout given by \c xTimeout expires.
 *               - If the flag \c OS_EVENT_NO_WAIT is set, this function shall
 *                 returns at once and \c pxReceivedEvents shall contain the

 *
 *  @param[in] xTimeout

/**
 *  @brief
 *    This function returns the operating system time in ms. It shall not depend 
 *    on the presence of a TDT table but should rely on the operating system or 
 *    CPU clock instead.
 *
 *  @return
 *    Operating system time in milliseconds.
 *
 *  @remarks
 *    -# The returned time values shall be monotonic over the full \c TOsTime
 *       range. The counter shall wrap around every 2^(8*sizeof(TOsTime)) ms.
 *    .
 *    -# If the system time is not expressed in ms, a simple linear conversion 
 *       is not sufficient to guarantee the monotonicity of the returned values. 
 *       One way to comply with this requirement is to increment a base counter 
 *       every second and, when the \c osTimerGet() function is called, return 
 *       the base counter value adjusted with the number of ms elapsed from the 
 *       last second.
