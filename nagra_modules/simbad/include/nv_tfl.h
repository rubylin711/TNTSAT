  Common definitions specific to the Nagra trusted framework layer interfaces.

  @details

  The Nagra <b>Trusted Framework Layers</b> includes several interfaces running 
  in rich and trusted execution environment. It introduces common trusted 
  definitions to both rich and trusted execution environment.
  Please make sure to have read the documentation pages for a complete 
  description of the interface constraints and requirements.
