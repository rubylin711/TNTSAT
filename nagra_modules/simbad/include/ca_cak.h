/**
 *  @brief
 *    Event purchase request (Obsolete).
 *
 *    This function allows the decoder manufacturer to send a request to the CA
 *    in order to purchase a pay-per-view event impulsively. To do so, the CA
 *    needs the DVB descriptors of the concerned event. They are formatted as
 *    found in an MPEG table [1]; see 3.2.1 for a brief description. In a DVB
 *    system, all the descriptors for this request are found in the SDT and
 *    EIT. The start time is extracted from the EIT (p/f or schedule) of the
 *    corresponding event.
 *
 *    It is advised to make a call to caEventInformationRequest() to ensure
 *    that the selected event is purchasable.
 *
 *    The processing of the request is performed asynchronously with regard to
 *    the calling task. The CA returns the resulting status by means of the
 *    provided callback function. The CA software can manage a burst of
 *    requests. Therefore, it is not necessary to wait for a response before
 *    sending another request.
 *
 *  @deprecated
 *
 *  @param   xEventPurchaseCallback
 *             Callback function called by the CA to return the resulting event
 *             impulse purchase status to the decoder.
 *  @param   pxPrivateData
 *             Reference to optional private data. It is passed to the callback
 *             function. Content of private data is independent of the CA.
