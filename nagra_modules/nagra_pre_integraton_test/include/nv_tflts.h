  @brief
  Defines the Nagra trusted framework layers session interface related to the 
  rich execution environment.

  @details
  This interface is used by the Nagra rich client running in the rich 
  execution environment. It allows it communicating with the Nagra trusted 
  client running on the trusted execution environment.

  @note
  Trusted environment technology is dependent on the platform definition
  making it available. The communication technology and layer between rich 
  and trusted environments is dependent of this platform technology. 
  The preliminary steps and processes required to establish this 
  communication path are in charge of the platform implementation.

    @brief
    This function opens a session with a trusted client.
      
    It allows the Nagra rich client executing in the rich environment to open 
    a session on the Nagra trusted client executing in the trusted environment.

    When the Nagra rich client calls this function, it must be blocked while 
    the trusted execution environment is requested to open a session on the 
    Nagra trusted client. The latter is called using 
    nvTrustedSessionOpenEntry(). 
    Once the trusted operation has been processed, the Nagra rich client 
    caller must be resumed with the results of the operation.

    When successful, this operation must provide a valid session handle; it 
    must be used to identify the trusted session in all subsequent related 
    operations. It is defined by the implementation of the function described 
    here. The value returned by the trusted operation must be provided back 
    as the returned value of this rich function call.

    @pre
    The trusted execution environment must be up and running.
    The rich execution environment must have set up the communication with the 
    trusted execution environment.

    @post
    The Nagra trusted client has been called using nvTrustedSessionOpenEntry(). 
    Its result is provided back as the return value of this operation. 
    A valid handle is set in *ppSession after successful processing or a 
    @c NULL value is set if the session opening failed.

    @param[out] ppSession
    Reference on the trusted session handle.

    @param[in]    select
    Internal selection parameter.

    @return
    The operation mainly returns the value returned by the distant trusted 
    operation; ::NV_TRUSTED_SUCCESS means the session with the trusted client 
    is successfully opened. An error means the session has not been opened. 
    Check ::TNvTrustedResult for a list of the possible returned values.
    Check also nvTrustedSessionOpenEntry() description for the meaning of the 
    trusted session open operation return values.
    However error codes can also be raised directly by the rich execution  
    execution environment implementation or by the trusted framework 
    independently of the trusted client operation result.
    These independent errors are detailed in the following return values.

    @retval ::NV_TRUSTED_ERROR_CLIENT_MEMORY
    The client environment runs out of memory.

    @retval ::NV_TRUSTED_ERROR_TRUSTED_MEMORY
    The trusted environment runs out of memory.

    @retval ::NV_TRUSTED_ERROR_COMMUNICATION
    The client environment failed to communicate with the trusted client.
    It can result from the following conditions but not limited to this list:
    + The rich execution environment failed to reach the trusted execution 
      environment.
    + The trusted client does not exist.
    + The trusted client is busy.
    + The trusted client denied the access to the rich client.

    @retval ::NV_TRUSTED_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETER
    The ppSession parameter is @c NULL.

    @retval ::NV_TRUSTED_ERROR
    An unexpected error occurs.

    @note
    The session handle returned by this function is not the session	context or 
    handle defined by the trusted operation within the trusted execution 
    environment. It must allow the implementation to identify the trusted 
    session to address.

    @note
    When the trusted session resource is no more needed, it must be closed 
    using ::INvTrustedSession::close().

    @see ::TNvTrustedResult, ::INvTrustedSession::close(), 
         ::INvTrustedSession::command(), nvTrustedSessionOpenEntry(), 
         @ref p_tfl_invoke "Trusted client invocation".

    This function closes a session with a trusted client.
      
    It allows the Nagra rich client executing in the rich execution 
    environment to close a session previously opened on the Nagra trusted 
    client executing in the trusted execution environment. A trusted session 
    must always be closed when no more needed.

    When the Nagra rich client calls this function, it must be blocked while 
    the trusted execution environment is requested to close a trusted session 
    associated to the Nagra trusted client. The latter must be called using 
    ::nvTrustedSessionCloseEntry. Once the trusted operation has been 
    processed, the Nagra rich client caller must be resumed.

    When the operation finally returns, the trusted session handle is no more 
    valid; it must no more be used with any trusted operation call.

    @pre
    A valid trusted session must have been previously opened successfully 
    using ::INvTrustedSession::open().

    @post
    The trusted client has been called using nvTrustedSessionCloseEntry(). 
    The trusted session handle is no more valid.

    This function process an operation with a trusted client.
      
    It allows the Nagra rich client executing in the rich execution 
    environment to process an operation with the Nagra trusted client 
    associated to the a trusted session. The latter must have been previously 
    opened successfully using ::INvTrustedSession::open().

    When the Nagra rich client calls this function, it must be blocked. The 
    memory blocks parameters must be provided to the trusted execution 
    environment; If memory blocks cannot be remapped in the trusted execution 
    environment and must be exchanged by copy, only the input and 
    input/output memory blocks should be exchanged and temporary trusted 
    output memory blocks should be allocated locally with the right size. The 
    Nagra trusted client associated to the trusted session must be called 
    using nvTrustedSessionCommandEntry(). Once the trusted operation has been 
    processed, output data must be provided back to the rich execution 
    environment as well as the returned value. If rich memory blocks have not 
    been directly remapped, output data must be copied back to rich memory 
    blocks and their size adjusted down consequently; local trusted output 
    memory blocks must be freed. The rich caller can therefore be resumed with 
    updated results.
    
    Refer to ::TNvTrustedBlock and related definitions for a detailed description 
    of the memory blocks.

    @pre
    A valid trusted session must have been previously opened successfully using
    ::INvTrustedSession::open().

    @post
    The trusted client has been called with nvTrustedSessionCommandEntry(). 
    The memory block parameters are updated according to their direction.

    @param[in]    pSession
    Trusted session handle.

    @param[in]    nBlocks
    Number of memory blocks provided in the @a pBlocks parameter.
    This number cannot be @c 0.

    @param[inout] pBlocks
    An array of ::TNvTrustedBlock; the number of blocks is provided with the 
    @a nBlocks parameter. It cannot be @c NULL.

    @return
    The operation mainly returns the value returned by the distant trusted 
    operation; ::NV_TRUSTED_SUCCESS means the command has been successfully 
    processed by the trusted client. An error means the operation has 
    failed. Memory blocks provided must still be updated according to their 
    direction and content. Refer to @ref s_tfl_invoke_outputs section for 
    further details. Check ::TNvTrustedResult for a list of the possible 
    returned values. Check also nvTrustedSessionCommandEntry() description 
    for the meaning of the trusted session command operation return values.
    However error codes can also be raised directly by the rich execution  
    environment implementation or by the trusted framework independently of 
    the trusted client operation result. These independent errors are detailed 
    in following the return values.

    @retval ::NV_TRUSTED_ERROR_CLIENT_MEMORY
    The rich execution environment runs out of memory.

    @retval ::NV_TRUSTED_ERROR_TRUSTED_MEMORY
    The trusted execution environment runs out of memory.

    @retval ::NV_TRUSTED_ERROR_COMMUNICATION
    The rich execution environment failed to communicate with the trusted 
    execution environment.

    @retval ::NV_TRUSTED_ERROR_BAD_PARAMETER
    A parameter is invalid or inconsistent:
    + The trusted session handle is invalid.
    + The number of memory blocks is @c 0.
    + The address of memory block array is @c NULL.
    + One of the memory block provided is invalid.
      i.e. its @a size field is @c NULL or its @a pAddr field is NULL.

    @retval ::NV_TRUSTED_ERROR_BLOCK_TOO_SHORT
    An output block is too short to hold the expected result.
    Refer to @ref s_tfl_invoke_outputs section for further details.

    @retval ::NV_TRUSTED_ERROR
    An unexpected error occurs.

    @see ::TNvTrustedResult, ::INvTrustedSession::open(), 
         ::INvTrustedSession::close(), nvTrustedSessionCommandEntry(), 
         @ref p_tfl_invoke "Trusted client invocation".

    @note
    All memory block allocations are managed by the Nagra rich client. 
    When a memory block is provided, it must refer a valid memory space whether 
    it is provided as input and/or output. Refer to @ref s_tfl_invoke_outputs section for 
    further details. Memory blocks may be remapped directly in the trusted 
    execution environment memory space if this feature is available or 
    transferred back and forth by copy according to their direction; in that 
    case local trusted temporary output memory blocks should be used.
